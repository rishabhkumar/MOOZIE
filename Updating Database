First of all, before doing any contributions, one must understand the whole code. It's Easy and fun.
After that, one can edit it easily by maybe adding new functions to it and then pulling requests, or else, they can simply increase its Database!


TO UPDATE DATABASE (For Non-Programmers):
(1) In the M1.C file, one may search for code snippet inlcuding lots of if(search------(so and so) else------
statements, right there after 'else', press spacebar and follow below steps(explained with an example)

   (1) TO REPLY "Hello Sir" when user enters, "hi" :
        
        
        if(search(input,"hi")==1
        {printf("\nHello Sir!");
        goto jump;}
        else
   
   
   (2) TO REPLY "Tata Sir" when user enters, "bye":
      if(search(input,"bye")==1
      {printf("\nTata Sir!");
      goto jump;}
      else
